/**
  This is the cartridge class for a "Wickstead Design" prototype cart.
  The ROM has 64 bytes of RAM.
  In this bankswitching scheme the 2600's 4K cartridge address space
  is broken into four 1K segments.  The desired arrangement of 1K banks
  is selected by accessing $30 - $3F of TIA address space.  The banks
  are mapped into all 4 segments at once as follows:

    $0030, $0038: 0,0,1,3
    $0031, $0039: 0,1,2,3
    $0032, $003A: 4,5,6,7
    $0033, $003B: 7,4,2,3

    $0034, $003C: 0,0,6,7
    $0035, $003D: 0,1,7,6
    $0036, $003E: 2,3,4,5
    $0037, $003F: 6,0,5,1


  (Removed: In the uppermost (third) segment, the byte at $3FC is overwritten by 0.)

  The 64 bytes of RAM are accessible at $1000 - $103F (read port) and
  $1040 - $107F (write port).  Because the RAM takes 128 bytes of address
  space, the range $1000 - $107F of segment 0 ROM will never be available.
