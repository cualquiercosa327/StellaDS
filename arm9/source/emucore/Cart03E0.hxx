/**
  This is the cartridge class for Parker Brothers' 8K games with special
  Brazilian bankswitching.  In this bankswitching scheme the 2600's 4K
  cartridge address space is broken into four 1K segments.

  The desired 1K bank of the ROM is selected as follows:
    If A12 == 0, A9 == 1, A8 == 1, A7 == 1 ($0380..$03ff):
      A4 == 0 ($03e0) loads the bank number for segment #0
      A5 == 0 ($03d0) loads the bank number for segment #1
      A6 == 0 ($03b0) loads the bank number for segment #2
    Bits A0, A1, A2 determine the bank number (0..7)

  The last 1K segment always points to the last 1K of the ROM image.

  Because of the complexity of this scheme, the cart reports having
  only one actual bank, in which pieces of it can be swapped out in
  many different ways.
